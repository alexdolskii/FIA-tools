# FIA-tools (Foci Imaging Assay)
This toolkit is optimized for medium-throughput, batch processing of large confocal images datasets from fibroblast/ECM 3D units, streamlining extraction and quantification of nuclear staining signals.

The project was oroginally developed as a part of the research **Pulsed low-dose-rate radiation reduces the tumor-promotion induced by conventional chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer-associated fibroblasts** in the  [Edna (Eti) Cukierman lab](https://www.foxchase.org/edna-cukierman).

# Aplication
A modular, semi-interactive toolbox for quantifying nuclear foci (e.g., Ki-67, apoptotic markers) and their colocalization in 3D fibroblast/ECM unit assays. FIA-tools complements (UMA-tools)[https://github.com/alexdolskii/UMA-tools] by focusing on per-nucleus foci counts and/or colocolization between multiple foci channels, areas while preserving a reproducible, batch-friendly workflow.

For detailed description of 3D fibroblast/ECM units please refer [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32222216/) and [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27245425/).

Input is a directory of .nd2 or .tif/.tiff confocal images representing Z-stacks with multiple detection channels (DAPI, fibronectin). To ensure correct channel mapping, keep the same channel order across every image.
Core stack: Python + FIJI/ImageJ (headless), StarDist (2D_versatile_fluo)
Use cases: punctate nuclear foci (Ki-67), pan-nuclear stains, and multi-marker colocalization

## Key features
Robust nuclei detection in noisy data with StarDist; watershed + particle analysis to split touching nuclei.
Flexible foci calls: user-defined thresholds per marker; supports multiple foci channels and co-localization (pairwise or multi-channel intersections).
Projection-aware preprocessing: Max Intensity Z-prrojection for nuclei; StdDev Z-projection for foci (ND2).
Transparent: extensive logging, safety prompts before overwriting, and structured output folders.

## Workflow (4 scripts)
**1) Image Pre-processing & Channel Extraction**
Interactively select channels (1 nuclei + 1..N foci). For .nd2 .tiff stacks, create Max Intensity Z-projections for nuclei and StdDev Z-projections for foci (XY). Standardize all images (resize to 1024Ã—1024, convert to 8-bit), save into foci_assay/ with per-channel subfolders, and record calibration in image_metadata.txt (pixel size, units, dimensions).

**2) Nuclei Segmentation & Mask Generation**
StarDist (2D_versatile_fluo) for nuclei masks; intensity normalization before inference.
Refinement: ImageJ particle analysis + watershed; minimum size filter to drop debris.
Output: timestamped nuclei mask folders; logs of warnings/errors for QA.

**3) Foci Detection & Mask Generation**
Validate inputs: finds latest nuclei masks; verifies foci channel folders; reads calibration.
Choose which foci set to process (e.g., Foci_1_Channel_1).
Thresholding: apply user-defined intensity threshold - binary foci masks, then watershed to split touching foci.
Output: timestamped Foci_Masks_* folders + detailed logs.

**4) Foci Quantification (with optional colocalization)**
Label nuclei and compute area metrics (pixels, ÂµmÂ²); save quick-look images with labeled IDs.
Per-nucleus foci stats: count, total foci area (pixels, ÂµmÂ²), and % nucleus area occupied by foci.
Colocalization (optional): build intersection masks across selected foci channels; compute the same metrics for overlapped regions.
Parallelized: speeds up large batches via multi-core processing.
Output: unified CSV (Pandas) merging single-channel and colocalization results; ready for downstream statistics.
Outputs
Masks: nuclei masks; per-channel foci masks; optional intersection masks.
QC images: labeled nuclei overlays for rapid visual validation.
Tables: image-level and consolidated CSVs with per-nucleus metrics; metadata file for calibration.
Logs: detailed processing history and warnings.

Conventions & notes
A single run can cover many folders/conditions defined in one JSON manifest.
Keep fluorescence channel order consistent across images within a run.
Thresholds and minimum object sizes materially affect sensitivityâ€”tune once, then batch.
For new cell types or stain characteristics, consider training a custom StarDist model for best accuracy.

# Installation 
To download and install *git* please visit [Git Download page](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

To download and install *conda* please visit [Miniforge github](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge)

To install the package please follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexdolskii/FIA-tools.git
cd FIA-tools
conda env create -f <linux_|mac_>environment.yaml
conda activate fia-tools
```

# Usage

The main input for all of the programms is `input_paths.json`. Therefore, previously it have to be modified. This file should contain a list of folders with `.nd2` images. The file can contain as many folders as needed.

Further, to implement analysis run all of the programs one after another:

#### 1_select_channels.py

```bash
chmod +x code/1_select_channels.py
# Run command
code/1_select_channels.py -i input_paths.json
```
#### 2_nuclei_mask_generation

```bash
chmod +x code/2_nuclei_mask_generation.py
# Run command
code/2_nuclei_mask_generation.py -i input_paths.json
```

To customize the thresholds for nuclei please use other *particle_size* parameter

```bash
code/2_nuclei_mask_generation.py -i input_paths.json -p 2000
```

#### 3_foci_mask_generation.py

```bash
chmod +x code/3_foci_mask_generation.py
# Run command
code/3_foci_mask_generation.py -i input_paths.json
```

To customize the thresholds for foci please use other *foci_threshold* parameter

```bash
code/3_foci_mask_generation.py  -i input_paths.json -f 100
```

#### 4_foci_quantification.py

```bash
chmod +x code/4_foci_quantification.py
code/4_foci_quantification.py -i input_paths.json
```
